# personal-blog-page


A multi-page website built using `HTML` and `CSS` skills which includes custom images, layout, and styling. Along with the webpage design considerations, I worked to appropriately structure the files, as well as use proper formatting & style. The project also focusses on using Flexbox and Grid systems to make the page responsive.
