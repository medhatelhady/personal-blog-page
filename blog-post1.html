                <p class="content-paragraph">First introduced over 35 years ago, C++ is one of the most commonly beloved programming languages.
                    In fact, according to Zippia.com, the demand for C++ developers 
                    will grow by 21%, creating 284,100 jobs in the United States alone between 2018 and 2028.</p>

                <p class="content-paragraph">
                    First and foremost, C++ is a programming language that assists in writing portable programs quickly and contains large library support using Standard Template Library (STL). It’s a foundational language. The is the first and main language to step away from code that looks like only a computer can read to something that humans can read and understand. C++ and its little cousin C are what high-level languages are coded in. It’s hardly new, so you’ve probably already used it without even knowing it.

                <h2 class="content-subtitle">5 Benefits of C++</h2>
                <ul class="content-paragraph" >
                    <li>Compiled — A code that must be compiled first into low-level code in order to be executed later, which is different from interpreted programming languages that do not require compilation.</li>
                    <li>Rich Library Support — The Standard Template Library (STL) contains resources to help write code quickly, like the standard libraries provided with containers such as maps, sets, and hash tables.</li>
                    <li>Pointer support — Despite pointers not typically being supported in other languages, C++ is able to support pointers while programming.</li>
                    <li>Object-Oriented — The language is object-oriented, so C++ will spotlight objects along with the manipulations around them. Info about how manipulations function can be abstracted using the consumer of the object.</li>
                    <li>Speed — It’s mostly used because of how quickly it operates. Compilation and execution are the quickest of just about any other programming language. Web browsers commonly use C++ because of speed quality. People won’t have to wait with swift action by the rendering engine, ideal for browsers being used for quick and easy access to the web.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="content-subtitle">Interesting In Getting Into C++ Development?</h2>
                <p class="content-paragraph">
                    C++ holds so much importance in the world of programming languages since just about all systems and programs are written in C and/or C++. This includes photo editing, Windows, video games, and even the web browser you’re using right now to read this at this very moment in time. C++ is essential in just about every application we need to work and play and will always be relevant.
